# Overview 
**This repo contains my implementations of the most popular supervised algorithms in real life problems.**.

I tried my best to give an overview of each problem on its readme file 

## Problems:
[Apparent Temperature Prediction](https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Problems/tree/main/Apparent%20Temperature%20Prediction "Apparent Temperature Prediction") : **Predicting the  `Apparent temperature`  using different regression models**.

[Churn Prediction](https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Problems/tree/main/Churn%20Prediction "Churn Prediction") : **Binary Classification by SVM and Logistic Regression to `get the customers who will probably churn`**.

[House Pricing Prediction](https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Problems/tree/main/House%20Pricing%20Prediction "House Pricing Prediction") : **House Pricing Prediction starts with Linear Regression way to the Regularized linear model to `get the probable price of any house based on its features`**.

[Income Prediction](https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Problems/tree/main/Income%20Prediction "Income Prediction") : **`Classify the  income of the user whether it is above or below 50K`  Using Tree-based algorithms and KNN**.

[Rain_Prediction](https://github.com/SalmaHisham/Supervised-Machine-Learning-Problems/tree/main/Rain_Prediction "Rain_Prediction") : **Binary Classification to `predict if it's gonna rain tomorrow or not`**.
